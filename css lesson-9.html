    Cowboy Bebop (Japanese: カウボーイビバップ, Hepburn: Kaubōi Bibappu) is a Japanese neo-noir space Western[12] anime television series 
    which aired on TV Tokyo and Wowow from 1998 to 1999. It was created and animated by Sunrise, 
    led by a production team of director Shinichirō Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, 
    mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno, who are collectively billed as Hajime Yatate.
    The series, which ran for twenty-six episodes (dubbed "sessions"), is set in the year 2071, 
    and follows the lives of a traveling bounty-hunting crew aboard a spaceship, the Bebop. 
    Although it incorporates a wide variety of genres, the series draws most heavily from science fiction, Western, and noir films. 
    Its most prominent themes are existential boredom, loneliness, and the inability to escape one's past.
    The series was dubbed into English by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions, 
    and was originally licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment 
    (and is now licensed by Crunchyroll) and in Britain by Beez Entertainment (now by Anime Limited); 
    Madman Entertainment owns the license in Australia and New Zealand. 
    In 2001, it became the first anime title to be broadcast on Adult Swim.
    Cowboy Bebop has been hailed as one of the greatest animated television series of all time. 
    It was a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets, most notably in the United States. 
    It garnered several major anime and science-fiction awards upon its release, 
    and received unanimous praise for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. 
    The English dub was particularly lauded, and is regarded as one of the best anime dubs.[13] 
    Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, 
    Cowboy Bebop has also been called a gateway series for anime as a whole.[14]
    In 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway which made Earth almost uninhabitable, 
    humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. 
    Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, 
    in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as "Cowboys") 
    chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward.[15] 
    The series' protagonists are bounty-hunters working from the spaceship Bebop. 
    The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, 
    and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist;
    Edward, an eccentric child, skilled in hacking; and Ein, 
    a genetically-engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence. 
    Over the course of the series, the team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, 
    while often confronting faces and events from their past:[16] these include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP, 
    and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.
    While much of the show is episodic in nature, the main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious, 
    an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon Syndicate. 
    Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, 
    but when Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend Julia and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her, 
    Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. 
    Julia goes into hiding to protect herself and Spike, while Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. 
    In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to complete their plan. 
    Vicious, having staged a coup d'état and taken over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. 
    Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. Spike leaves the Bebop after saying a final goodbye to Faye and Jet. 
    Upon infiltrating the syndicate,
     he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. 
     The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to be seriously wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation. 
     Looking up to the sky, Spike sees Julia. 
     The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the 
     building into the rising sun before eventually falling to the ground.
